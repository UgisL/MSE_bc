This software repository currently has two software packadges, connected with
different scientific contributions:
Porous_full_bc2ifScales    -- software for porous structures with 2 interface
                              velocity scales
                              Associated scientific contributions:
                              <arXiv:1604.02880>
Poroelastic_fill_strCont   -- software for poroelastic structures with
                              bc2ifScales velocity condition and stress
                              continuity condition
                              (will appear soon)
