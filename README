This is README file of software flowMSE v1.01.

This software is a script compilation for FreeFem++ <http://www.freefem.org/>
to solve interface cell problems and arrive with coefficients in boundary
condition (BC) between porous medium and free fluid. It also allows to solve
for some example macroscale problems using those boundary conditions.

The flowMSE software is licensed under LGPLv3 license.

This software currently has one module 2D_MSE_bc_velocity. This module gives the
possibility to compute the coefficients for BC in two-dimensions (2D) for porous
case. It also contains an example solver to employ the developed boundary con-
dition. If you find this software useful, please cite the corresponding publi-
cation <arXiv:1604.02880> (arXiv preprint) or <> (under consideration for JFM).

The module 2D_MSE_bc_velocity contains
src/2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp        -- script to solve for K tensor
src/2D_MSE_bc_Lsolver.edp        -- script to solve for L tensor
src/2D_MSE_solver.edp            -- script to solve a Cavity problem with
                                    developed boundary conditions
doc/2D_MSE_bc_velocity.pdf       -- explanation of variational formulation and
                                    script parameters

In the near future, this software will be extended to three-dimensions and also
stress boundary condition.

 Quick-start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Unix)

In order to run this software, change the current directory to <src> folder of
the selected module and, for example, to get solution in 2D for K components,
execute in the command line
# FreeFem++ 2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp

The results will be plotted on the screen as well as saved to a text file. For
headless execution (such as cluster) use
# FreeFem++-nw 2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp

(Windows)

Open the script 2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp by graphical FreeFem++ dialogue.
