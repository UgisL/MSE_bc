This is README file of software repository flowMSE

This software is a script compilation for FreeFem++ <http://www.freefem.org/>
created within our work on homogenised description of textured, porous and
poroelastic materials.

This software repository currently has two software packages, connected with
different scientific contributions:
Porous_full_bc2ifScales    -- software determining coefficients in boundary
                              conditions for textured and porous structures.
                              It was originally associated with set of boundary
                              conditions obtained through multi-scale expansion
                              as explained in these scientific contributions:
                              <DOI:10.1017/jfm.2016.838> (open-access)
                              <arXiv:1604.02880>
                              Since April 2019, the routines are being updated
                              to provide coefficients for semi-rigorous higher
                              order boundary conditions, as described in
                              scientific contributions:
                              <arXiv:1812.09401>
Poroelastic_fill_strCont   -- software for poroelastic structures with
                              bc2ifScales velocity condition and stress
                              continuity condition
                              Associated scientific contributions:
                              <DOI:10.1098/rspa.2016.0932> (open-access)
                              <arXiv:1701.03596>
