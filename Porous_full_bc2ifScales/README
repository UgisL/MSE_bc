This is README file of software Porous_full_bc2ifScales.

This software is a script compilation for FreeFem++ <http://www.freefem.org/>
to solve interface cell problems and arrive with coefficients in boundary
condition (BC) between porous medium or textured surface and a free fluid.
It also allows to solve
for lid-driven macroscale problem using those boundary conditions. If you find
this software useful, please cite the corresponding publication <arXiv:1604.02880>
(arXiv preprint) or <doi:10.1017/jfm.2016.838> (JFM open access article).
The latest update includes improvements in the solver (treating interface cell
as a monolithic domain), more automation as well as addition of BC coefficients
for a semi-rigorous next order TR model, see corresponding work
<arXiv:1812.09401> (arXiv preprint) or <> (under consideration for JFM). The
update is motivated by the fact that both <doi:10.1017/jfm.2016.838> and
<arXiv:1812.09401> make use of same interface cell set-ups, already implemented
in the current open source repository. Currently the improved solver
is implemented for 2D configurations only, but 3D implementation will follow.

This software currently has two modules:
2D_MSE_bc_velocity    -- module for 2D disconnected structures
3D_MSE_bc_velocity    -- module for 3D connected structures

 General description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The module 2D_MSE_bc_velocity allows the user to compute the coefficients for BC
in two-dimensions (2D) for porous case. It also contains an example solver to
employ the developed boundary condition on led-driven cavity problem.
It is easy to switch between porous materials consisting of istropic cylinders,
tilted elipses or layered cylinders. One can also define simple repeating
structures through use of macros. The length of the interface cell can be
easily modified to include different number of structures.

The module 2D_MSE_bc_velocity contains
src/2D_MSE_bc_solver.edp         -- script to solve for BC coefficient tensors
                                    and vectors

 Quick-start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Unix)

In order to run this software, change the current directory to <src> folder of
the selected module and, to get coefficients for BCs, execute in the command line
# FreeFem++ -ne 2D_MSE_bc_solver.edp

The results will be plotted on the screen as well as outputted to console. For
headless execution (such as in a cluster) use
# FreeFem++-nw -ne 2D_MSE_bc_solver.edp

(Windows)

Open the script 2D_MSE_bc_solver.edp by graphical FreeFem++ dialogue.

 General description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The module 3D_MSE_bc_velocity allows the user to compute the coefficients for BC
in three-dimensions (3D) for porous case. Current implementation use regular
array of spheres, connected by cylinders in all directions, in the porous bed.
The script, generating the geometry *.geo file can be modified for any regular
structure in mind.

The module 3D_MSE_bc_velocity contains
src/3D_MSE_bc_parameters.in      -- example input file with problem parameters
src/3D_MSE_bc_gen_geom.py        -- script that generates the geometry and mesh
                                    definition
src/3D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp        -- script to solve for K tensor
src/3D_MSE_bc_Lsolver.edp        -- script to solve for L tensor
doc/3D_MSE_bc_velocity.pdf       -- explanation of procedure to obtain the
                                    necessary coefficients for BC
