This is README file of software Poroelastic_fill_strCont.

This software is a script compilation for FreeFem++ <http://www.freefem.org/>
to solve interface cell problems and arrive with coefficients in boundary
condition (BC) between porous medium and free fluid. It also allows to solve
for lid-driven macroscale problem using those boundary conditions. If you find
this software useful, please cite the corresponding publication <>
(arXiv preprint) or <> (under consideration for Proc. Roy. Soc. A).

 Quick-start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Unix)

--> To obtain the interior and interface coefficients for particular microscale
geometry:
    1) In directory "src/0_setup" execute:
    ./3D_MSE_gen_geom.py
    gmsh -3 3D_MSE_gen_geomI.geo
    gmsh -3 3D_MSE_gen_geomIs.geo
    gmsh -3 3D_MSE_gen_geomB.geo
    gmsh -3 3D_MSE_gen_geomL.geo
    gmsh -3 3D_MSE_gen_geomT.geo
    2) In directory "src/1_Interior" execute
    FreeFem++ -nw 3D_interiorK_solver.edp
    FreeFem++ -nw 3D_interiorC_solver.edp
    3) In directory "src/2_Interface" execute
    ./3D_MSE_bc_do_all.sh

Now the interior parameters can be found in files "3D_interiorK_matrix.txt" and
"3D_interiorC_matrices.txt" and the interface parameters can be found in files
"3D_MSE_bc_Ki*_intf.txt" and "3D_MSE_bc_Li*3_intf.txt", where "*" goes from "1"
to "3".

--> To execute the solver for effective/averaged model equations and obtain
the macroscopic flow and displacement fields for cavity problem:
    1) In directory "src/3_effective_solver" execute:
    FreeFem++ 2DfluidPEmedium_cavity_UnsteadyNStokes.edp

If the unix machine have graphical interface, this software would first display
the two generated meshes for both free fluid and poroelastic domains. After the
end of simulation, the final flow fields and displacement fields are displayed
using coloured isocountour plots. Also, four line probes are exported as text
files.

--> To post-process and investigate the DNS fields of the same cavity problem
    1) In directory "src/4_DNS_solver" execute:
    tar -xvf 3D_DNS_solution.tar.gz
    FreeFem++ -nw 3D_DNS_post_line.edp
    FreeFem++ -nw 3D_DNS_post.edp

Executing these two post-processing tools will give line probes of both raw
field data and also y-averaged field data. For further post-processing options,
consult FreeFem++ documentation. For comments on obtaining the DNS fields, see
the documentation.

(Windows)

The easiest would be to set up Unix environment either through virtual
machine or MinGW.
