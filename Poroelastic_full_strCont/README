This is README file of software Poroelastic_fill_strCont.

This software is a script compilation for FreeFem++ <http://www.freefem.org/>
to solve interface cell problems and arrive with coefficients in boundary
condition (BC) between porous medium and free fluid. It also allows to solve
for lid-driven macroscale problem using those boundary conditions.
